As IT professionals, we spend entirely too much time trying to one-up each other. While reading this post,
you might be thinking how your blog is cleaner, it has more features, it accepts comments! You can't help
yourself, you just naturally critique other people's work, because that's part of your job. If I'm honest,
I'm probably as critical of my own work as I am of other people's work, but that self-critique is not as
visible day-to-day. I'd argue, the critique of others should be similarly hidden.

We have to remember that everyone is somewhere on the spectrum from idiot to expert
