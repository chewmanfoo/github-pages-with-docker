I have written a kazillion short stories and one screenplay and have started another.

I want to join some sort of Writers Guild in North Texas.  I found the following on the web:

    * [Writers League of Texas][writers-league]

    * membership: $50 individual, $80 couple
    * plusses: lots of exposure, State-wide writers to meet and mingle, events are great
    * minuses: mostly in Austin

    * [Dallas Screenwriters Association][dallas-screenwriters]

    * membership: #85 individual, $45 each additional family member
    * plusses: local (Dallas, anyways)
    * minuses: expensive
