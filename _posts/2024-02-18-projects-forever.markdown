I have projects forever. I have so many projects, I find myself arranging my projects in dependency trees which are
so long, complex, computationally intensive that my brain gets lost wondering where to start. And I dare not pick
a particular project to favor, because when I think about accomplishing it, I get lost in the dependencies, I really
can't figure out where it belongs. How to start? Hell, how do you define The First Step?

And I'm a dad. Being a dad means I already have daddy-dos and honey-dos numerous enough to occupy my time from here till
my natural death all on their own. But as an honest, red-blooded American who grew up in the age of Woz and DHH and 
Spock and Dominic Giampaolo and Cyril Meurillon, I can't just confine my aspirations to simple tasks. That's why I
have more prototype boards than I'll ever solder, more wire than I'll ever need for bodges, more technical manuals
than I'll ever read, not to mention kindle files outlining White Hat Hacking, how-to-build-a-robot guides, etc. etc. 
etc. 

I'm into coding. I'm into speelunking and tunneling. I like woodworking and metal working and concrete working and house
building. I like to read, and write, and compose music, and dungeon master. I'm addicted to Youtube and Podcasts and 
Kindle and Reddit. I have to set an alarm to go to bed, otherwise I'd find myself tinkering at 4:00am and getting no
decent sleep for weeks at a time.

Hoarding? I'm way past that! I have more beryllium (in the form of magnetrons) than the EPA would probably allow if they
knew. I'm _inspired_, not repulsed, by The Radioactive Boyscout. I have a special way I shimmy through my piles and 
stacks so as to not fall into them and never be heard from again. And I dream of building the warehouse at the end of 
Raiders, where I can build shelves as far as the eye can see, and stash all my junk.

Anyway, I say all that to say this: fear not, if you're just like me. I've figured out that life has meaning only if 
you lose yourself in your projects. One day, they'll have to clean up all this mess. I'm hoping they find some
value in my treasures.

And all the boxes marked DO NOT DROP - don't drop them, seriously.
